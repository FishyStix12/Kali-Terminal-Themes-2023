#       Title: Kali Theme Creator
#       Authors: Nicholas Fisher and Dawson Smith
#       Date: November 16 2023
#       Description of Script:
#	This script makes custom Kali Linux Themes for the Terminal. It first asks
#	the user for the title they want to create for the and appends it the
#	.zshrc and .bashrc file then asks the user for the ASCII art the would like for their
#	theme and applies it to the .zshrc file. Finally it provides the user
#	with a link to a site that contains all the emojis that work in the
#	Kali linux Terminal, then asks the users for emojis they want to see
#	in their terminal prompt and those emoji's will be pasted as a comment
#	in the .zshrc and bash.rc files and the user will need to input the
#	emojis in the prompt_symbol=" variable in the .zshrc file.
