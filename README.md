# Kali-Terminal-Themes-2023
# By: Nicholas Fisher
This repository was made to brighten up a kali terminal programmer's day! Welcome to Kali Linux Terminal Themes for 2023-2024. In order for these themes to work <br />
For Both the Halloweentheme and Christmastheme scripts: <br />
1. Copy the prompt_christmas and prompt_halloween emojis in the prompt and paste them into the "**prompt_symbol**" variable within the "**.zshrc**" file in Kali Linux.
2. Ensure that you have installed the "**figlet**" and "**lolcat**" tools on your Kali instance. <br />
Thank you for using my scripts, and have a hacky holiday!
